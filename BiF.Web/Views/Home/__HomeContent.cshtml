    <h3>The Dates</h3>
    <p>
        <div style="margin: 6px 20px">
            <b>Sign Ups:</b> November 10 - December 1
        </div>
        <div style="margin: 6px 20px">
            <b>Matching:</b> December 4
        </div>
        <div style="margin: 6px 20px">
            <b>Shipping deadline:</b> December 15 (report shipping by 12/17)
        </div>

    </p>
    
    <h3>The Rules</h3>
    
    <p>
        You need to have completed at least 10 trades (on any platform), 2 BiF exchanges, or some combination to participate.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        All participants will need to send a minimum of 125oz of really fucking good beer, rated 4.1 or above on BA/Untappd.  There is no such thing as too much, but there is no guarantee you'll get an equally generous box in return.
    </p>

    <div style="font-style: italic; font-size: .9em; margin: auto; max-width: 400px; text-align:center">
        "Do you know where I can find that guy that dropped 200oz of awesome on my porch last year?" 
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center">
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Tep4DbK.gif" />
    </div>
    
    <p>
        Only 125oz must be rated 4.1 or above, so you can send that criminally underrated foeder-aged pilsner (because what do the unappreciative masses on Untappd know about true craft lagers!), but get those 125oz of incredible out of the way first.
    </p>

    <p>
            As always, this is a Christmas exchange - don't be a Grinch, or a Krampus, or an errant BB. Grabbing a mixed six of barrel-aged Founders and a few good IPAs technically fulfills the requirement, but that's the BiF equivalent of a stocking full of underwear.

            Remember, BiF's are about sharing great beer, spreading the Christmas spirit, and having fun.  They're not about winning and losing.  However, we can all agree the box itsalongwaydown received made him the loser last year, so don't be the guy that ships the box (bucket) full of turds.
