    <h2>It's a Christmas-in-July Miracle!</h2>

    <p>
        Are you ready for porch beer season? Dreaming of a sudsy poolside quaffer? Salivating for a crispy boi al fresco?  Lusting after a hoppy patio banger?
    </p>
    <p>
        Well... how about we help make that happen?
    </p>

    <p>
        This summer, we're presenting a warm weather-centric, day drinking friendly, Secret Santa.  And to make this one extra accessible, there will be 
        two tiers - the Standard exchange, and a second "Pro" tier with higher minimums and rewards. The goal is to make this exchange really easy for everyone 
        to participate and get back to the core principles of forwarding objectively good, under the local beer.
    </p>

    </div>

    <h3>The Setup</h3>

    <p>
        Just like the Holiday Secret Santa Exchange, matches will be half blind - you'll know who you're sending to, but not know who is sending to you. 
        Unlike the Secret Santa, we won't have a hard ship date. This will allow everyone to plan their box around the local brewery release schedules 
        so you're sending the best, freshest beer you can find.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <i><b>If you're traveling this summer, add a Note to your profile under "What should your match know..." or "Delivery Instructions" with 
            the dates you can't receive beer at your address.</b></i>
    </p>

    <h3>The Exchanges</h3>
    <p>
        <b>The Standard</b>: 128oz minimum with a 4.0 average Untappd rating.  There is no minimum rating for an individual beer - ship anything as long 
        as the best 128oz averages to 4.0.  This should allow everyone the flexibility to ship that awesome, but underrated pils. You must include a 
        minimum of 8 different beers (no, you can't just send two 64oz growlers and call it a day). [<a href="@Url.Action("SignUp", "Exchanges", new {id = 5})">Sign Up</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>The Pro</b>: The same basic rules as the Standard, but the minimum is 160oz and 10 unique beers. To further the challenge, two beers must be lagers 
        and two must be farmhouse ales. The top shippers in this tier will be allowed to give us a preference list for their Holiday Secret Santa matching. 
        Judging will be based on variety, quality, and probably a d20 roll. [<a href="@Url.Action("SignUp", "Exchanges", new {id = 6})">Sign Up</a>]
    </p>    
    <p>
        The best news is, each tier is a separate exchange, so you can sign up for BOTH tiers. Mathematically, two summer boxes is 7.643 times better than one summer 
        box (no one fact check that).  However, if either exchange fails to hit enough participants, we'll cancel the Pro and roll everyone into the Standard.
    </p>

            You need to have done some past beer trades, or exchanges, or swaps.  If you've done this before, you're probably good. If not use the past experience section of the profile form to make your argument.
        </p>

        <p>
            All participants will need to send a minimum of <b>155oz</b> of really fucking good beer, rated <b>4.1 or above</b> on Untappd. The average box last year was almost 200oz and the average rating was 4.26. We won't restrict your outpouring of holiday spirit again this year, but there is no guarantee you'll get an equally generous box in return. Based on the poll, we chose to up the minimum a little bit this year.  Two cans of freshies should fill the difference for those worried.

    Only 155oz must be rated 4.1 or above, so you can send that ridiculously unappreciated farmhouse ale you love - the one brewed in the traditional method over super-heated stones imported from North Ostrobothnia and flavored with juniper foraged from head brewer's backyard - but get those 155oz of objectively well-rated beer out of the way first.  Face it - everyone just wants that 'tose.

    As always, this is a Christmas exchange - don't be a Grinch. (I recognize in the third act, the Grinch soften and becomes nice. However, he only returns what was stolen - he doesn't gift anything new. And then he rapidly develops hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and probably dies shortly after the story wraps. Don't be that Grinch either.)

        You need to have completed at least 10 trades (on any platform), 2 BiF exchanges, or some combination to participate.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        All participants will need to send a minimum of 125oz of really fucking good beer, rated 4.1 or above on BA/Untappd.  There is no such thing as too much, but there is no guarantee you'll get an equally generous box in return.
    </p>

    <div style="font-style: italic; font-size: .9em; margin: auto; max-width: 400px; text-align:center">

    </div>
    
    <p>
        Only 125oz must be rated 4.1 or above, so you can send that criminally underrated foeder-aged pilsner (because what do the unappreciative masses on Untappd know about true craft lagers!), but get those 125oz of incredible out of the way first.
    </p>

    <p>
        As always, this is a Christmas exchange - don't be a Grinch, or a Krampus, or an errant BB. Grabbing a mixed six of barrel-aged Founders and a few good IPAs technically fulfills the requirement, but that's the BiF equivalent of a stocking full of underwear.
